# CFD-Solver-Development-for-External-and-Internal-Flow-
Developed custom MATLAB solvers to simulate internal laminar pipe flow across Reynolds numbers (Re = 100, 400, 2000) using both the Finite Difference Method (FDM) and Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM), comparing them on accuracy, stability, and runtime
